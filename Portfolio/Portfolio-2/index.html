                <h4>COACHING TECHNIQUE</h4>
                <p>I’ve honed my coaching technique over the decades. I aim to communicate openly and clearly, addressing critical points
                and providing continuous, constructive feedback.</p>

                        <h4>GOALS</h4>
                        <p>The process starts with clearly defined objectives. How will you know how to change if you don’t know what needs
                        changing. We’ll develop your goals in conversation together.

                        <h4>GROWTH</h4>
                        <p>The growth stage is the meat in the sandwich. It is here that you put new strategies to work, and begin addressing the
                        issues that have been holding you back.

                        <h4>REFLECTION</h4>
                        <p>At this point in the process I ask you to reflect on the changes you’ve made, and whether you’re satisfied with there the results have led you. After this, we can address sustainability.

                    <p>“Oving helped me regain my confidence after being fired and helped me find a healthy routine that put me on track
                    towards changing my career path. Now, I’m doing something that I always wanted to do.”</p>

                        at school. I gained confidence, started taking more chances, and am even working towards getting into college.”</p>
